# a_simple_shopping_system
a super simple shopping system (in Japanese) as my first Python project

"script.py" is the main script.

menu_item.py is a class that
  returns a name of menu items and prices, and
  returns the total price of items.

"food.py" and "drink.py" are classes that return informations of
food menu and drink menu, which are inherited from "memu_item.py"
