# a Simple Shopping System
a super simple shopping system (in _Japanese_) as my first Python project

"__script.py__" is the main script.

"__menu_item.py__' is a class that
- returns a name of menu items and prices, and
- returns the total price of items.

"__food.py__" and "__drink.py__" are classes that return informations of
food menu and drink menu, which are inherited from "__memu_item.py__"
